New improved iptables tool, based on my earlier project Easy Linux Firewall, but rewritten from scratch using Perl and Bash. It's a simple rewrite for now, but i am working on adding some new features.

If you'd like to try it you will have to use the SVN repository, because there are no other downloads at this time.
