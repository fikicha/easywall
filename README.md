New improved iptables tool, based on my earlier project Easy Linux Firewall, but rewritten from scratch using Perl and Bash. It's a simple rewrite for now, but i am working on adding some new features.

If you'd like to try it you will have to use the Git repository, because there are no other downloads at this time.

I'm currently working on some new srcitps to add to the project and also on creating packages for the most popular distros, since the project will be distributed only as binary packages.

If you'd like to help or have a suggestion, please contact me.
